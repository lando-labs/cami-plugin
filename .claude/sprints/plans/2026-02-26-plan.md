## Issue Analysis

| # | Title | Focus Area | Version Impact | Scope |
|---|-------|------------|----------------|-------|
| 37 | Align config format with existing CAMI workspace | Config | PATCH | Medium |
| 36 | Add source lifecycle management | Sources | MINOR | Large |
| 35 | Implement CAMI_WORKSPACE_PATH env var support | Config | PATCH | Small |
| 34 | Standardize manifest format | Config | PATCH | Small |
| 9 | Integration testing and v1.0.0 release | Release | MINOR | Large |
| 1 | Epic: Convert CAMI to skills-only plugin | Epic | - | Tracking |

## Grouping Strategy

**Config Alignment Group** (#37, #35, #34):
- All related to configuration format consistency
- Must be fixed before v1.0.0 release
- Natural grouping - same files, same concerns

**Feature Enhancement** (#36):
- New capability: source lifecycle management
- Adds git init, publish workflows
- Should come after config is stable

**Release Preparation** (#9):
- Integration testing checklist
- Depends on config issues being resolved

## Sprint 1 (Current): Config Alignment

- **Target Version**: v1.0.0-rc.4 → v1.0.0-rc.5 (PATCH)
- **Focus Area**: Configuration Format Consistency
- **Issues**: #37, #35, #34
- **Estimated Scope**: Medium (1 session)

### Rationale
These issues are blocking v1.0.0 release. The plugin was built with JSON config but existing CAMI users have YAML workspaces. This breaks compatibility and must be fixed first.

### Key Changes
1. **#37** - Convert all skill references from JSON to YAML format
   - Update `manage-sources/SKILL.md`
   - Update `manage-capabilities/SKILL.md`
   - Update `create-project/SKILL.md`
   - Rewrite `reference/config-schema.md`
   
2. **#35** - Add env var support to all skills
   - Check `$CAMI_WORKSPACE_PATH` before using default
   - Update workspace resolution logic
   
3. **#34** - Standardize manifest format
   - Choose: `capabilities` vs `deployed` root key
   - Choose: `added_at` vs `deployed_at` timestamp
   - Update all skill references

### Files to Touch
- `skills/manage-sources/SKILL.md`
- `skills/manage-capabilities/SKILL.md`
- `skills/create-project/SKILL.md`
- `skills/cami/SKILL.md`
- `reference/config-schema.md`

### Dependencies
- None (foundational work)

## Sprint 2 (Next): Source Lifecycle

- **Target Version**: v1.0.0-rc.5 → v1.0.0 (MINOR)
- **Focus Area**: Source Management Features
- **Issues**: #36
- **Estimated Scope**: Medium (1 session)

### Rationale
After config is aligned, we can add the missing source lifecycle features. Users need to create sources, init git repos, and publish to GitHub.

### Key Changes
1. **#36** - Add 4 new workflows to manage-sources:
   - Workflow 6: Create Local Source
   - Workflow 7: Initialize Git Repository
   - Workflow 8: Connect to Remote
   - Workflow 9: Push/Sync Changes

### Files to Touch
- `skills/manage-sources/SKILL.md` (major update)
- `reference/sources/` (new patterns)

### Dependencies
- Sprint 1 must complete (config format must be stable)

---

## Sprint 3 (Future): v1.0.0 Release

- **Target Version**: v1.0.0 (MINOR - first stable release)
- **Focus Area**: Integration Testing & Release
- **Issues**: #9
- **Estimated Scope**: Large (1-2 sessions)

### Rationale
With config aligned and source lifecycle complete, we can do comprehensive integration testing and release v1.0.0.

### Key Activities
From #9 checklist:
- [ ] Plugin structure validation (all files present)
- [ ] Skill testing (all 5 skills)
- [ ] Agent testing (agent-architect, skill-architect)
- [ ] Voice consistency testing
- [ ] Local testing with `claude --plugin-dir`
- [ ] Bump version to 1.0.0
- [ ] Create GitHub release

### Files to Touch
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (version bump)
- All skills (verification)
- README.md (final polish)

### Dependencies
- Sprint 1 complete (config)
- Sprint 2 complete (source lifecycle)

---

## Ordering Rationale

1. **Config First**: The format mismatch is a compatibility bug. Existing CAMI users would have broken workflows. This must be fixed before any new features.

2. **Source Lifecycle Second**: This is the most-requested feature gap. Users can't create and share agent sources without it.

3. **Release Last**: Testing and release should happen after all feature work is complete to avoid multiple release candidates.

## What Should Be Next (Sprint 4+)

After v1.0.0 release, consider:

- **Error recovery patterns** - From original epic (#18)
- **Confirmation patterns** - From original epic (#19)
- **Full update workflow** - Cross-skill coordination (#20)
- **Additional guild support** - More official guilds

## Next Steps

1. **Create Sprint 1 manifest**: `manifests/v1.0.0-rc.5-config-alignment.md`
2. **Start sprint**: Hydrate issues from GitHub
3. **Create branch**: `sprint/v1.0.0-rc.5-config-alignment`
