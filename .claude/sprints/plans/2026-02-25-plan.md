## Sprint 1 (Current): Core Foundation + Scout Persona

### Overview
- **Target Version**: v0.1.0 → v1.0.0-alpha.1 (MINOR - first functional version)
- **Focus Area**: Plugin foundation - the scout persona and core infrastructure
- **Estimated Scope**: Medium (1-2 sessions)

### Issues (Must Complete)
- [ ] #2: Create CLAUDE.md with scout persona and skill routing (priority:high)
- [ ] #7: Create config.yaml template (priority:medium)
- [ ] #8: Create README.md with plugin documentation (priority:medium)

### Rationale
The CLAUDE.md is the heart of the plugin - it establishes CAMI's identity and routes all user interactions. Without it, no skills work. Config template and README are essential for users to understand and configure the plugin.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] CLAUDE.md establishes scout persona with clear voice
- [ ] Skill routing patterns documented and functional
- [ ] config.yaml template covers all source types
- [ ] README provides installation and quick start guide

### Dependencies
- None (foundational sprint)

### Parallel Work Considerations
- **Sprint Scope**: `CLAUDE.md`, `templates/`, `README.md`
- **Protected Areas**: None yet (greenfield)

## Sprint 2 (Next): Core Skills - Capability & Source Management

### Overview
- **Target Version**: v1.0.0-alpha.1 → v1.0.0-beta.1 (MINOR - core functionality)
- **Focus Area**: The two primary skills that manage agents and sources
- **Estimated Scope**: Large (2-3 sessions)

### Issues (Must Complete)
- [ ] #3: Create manage-capabilities skill (priority:high)
- [ ] #4: Create manage-sources skill (priority:high)

### Issues (Nice to Have)
- [ ] #14: Implement tech stack auto-discovery (priority:medium)

### Rationale
These are the workhorses of CAMI. `manage-capabilities` handles listing, deploying, scanning, and updating agents/skills. `manage-sources` handles adding and updating capability sources. Together they form the complete "get agents into your project" workflow.

Auto-discovery (#14) enhances UX by detecting project tech stack automatically, but can be deferred if scope is too large.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Can list agents from configured sources
- [ ] Can deploy agents to target projects
- [ ] Can scan deployed agents for updates
- [ ] Can add sources (git URL, official guild shorthand)
- [ ] Can update sources (git pull)
- [ ] Can check source compliance

### Dependencies
- Sprint 1 must complete (CLAUDE.md routes to these skills)

### Parallel Work Considerations
- **Sprint Scope**: `skills/manage-capabilities/`, `skills/manage-sources/`
- **Protected Areas**: CLAUDE.md (finalized in Sprint 1)

## Sprint 3 (Future): Agent Creation + Architects

### Overview
- **Target Version**: v1.0.0-beta.1 → v1.0.0-rc.1 (MINOR - creation capability)
- **Focus Area**: Creating new agents via create-agent skill + architect updates
- **Estimated Scope**: Large (2-3 sessions)

### Issues (Must Complete)
- [ ] #5: Create create-agent skill (priority:high)
- [ ] #21: Update agent-architect to v5.0.0 (priority:high)
- [ ] #22: Verify skill-architect readiness (documentation)

### Rationale
This sprint enables the "create" part of CAMI - not just deploying existing agents, but creating new ones. The agent-architect v5.0.0 update is critical as it introduces the two-class system (methodology vs implementation) that aligns with the skills-only architecture.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] create-agent skill guides users through agent creation
- [ ] Properly distinguishes agent vs skill use cases
- [ ] agent-architect v5.0.0 implements two-class system
- [ ] skill-architect verified compatible with plugin context
- [ ] Clear handoff between agent-architect and skill-architect

### Dependencies
- Sprint 2 must complete (manage-capabilities for deployment)

### Parallel Work Considerations
- **Sprint Scope**: `skills/create-agent/`, `agents/`
- **Protected Areas**: manage-capabilities, manage-sources (complete)

---

## Ordering Rationale

### Why this order?

1. **Foundation First (Sprint 1)**: CLAUDE.md is the entry point. Without the scout persona and routing, nothing else works. Users need README and config template to even start using the plugin.

2. **Core Operations (Sprint 2)**: The primary user journey is "find agents → add to project". manage-capabilities and manage-sources enable this complete workflow. This gets CAMI to "usable" state.

3. **Creation Layer (Sprint 3)**: Once users can manage existing agents, they'll want to create custom ones. The architect updates are timed here because create-agent depends on agent-architect.

### What's Deferred

| Issue | Reason | Target |
|-------|--------|--------|
| #6: create-project | Nice-to-have after core skills work | Sprint 4 |
| #9: Integration testing & v1.0.0 | After all core skills complete | Sprint 5 |
| #18, #19, #20: Documentation | Can be done after skills exist to document | Sprint 4-5 |

---

## What Should Be Next (Sprint 4+)

### Sprint 4: Polish + Secondary Features
- #6: Create create-project skill
- #18: Document error recovery patterns
- #19: Document confirmation patterns

### Sprint 5: Release Prep
- #9: Integration testing and v1.0.0 release
- #20: Document full update workflow
- Final polish and bug fixes

## Version Roadmap

| Sprint | Version | Milestone |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Sprint 1 | v1.0.0-alpha.1 | Foundation complete |
| Sprint 2 | v1.0.0-beta.1 | Core skills functional |
| Sprint 3 | v1.0.0-rc.1 | Agent creation enabled |
| Sprint 4 | v1.0.0-rc.2 | Polish + secondary features |
| Sprint 5 | v1.0.0 | Production release |

---

## Notes

- Epic #1 tracks overall conversion progress - close when v1.0.0 ships
- All sprints work within the cami-plugin repo (separate from marketplace)
- Skills reference the cami-workspace model but plugin itself is standalone
