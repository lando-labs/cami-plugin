### Issue #29: Add help system to cami entry skill

**State**: Open

#### Summary

Add a structured help system to the `cami` entry skill that combines a brief intro with a scannable command list.

#### Proposed Help Output

```
CAMI: "I'm your agent scout - I help you build championship teams
of AI specialists for your projects.

DEPLOY & MANAGE
  'deploy [agent]'      - Add an agent to this project
  'list agents'         - Show available and deployed
  'scan for updates'    - Check for newer versions
  'remove [agent]'      - Remove an agent from this project

SOURCES (Optional)
  'add source [name]'   - Add a reference source
  'list sources'        - Show configured sources
  'update sources'      - Pull latest from git sources

CREATE
  'create an agent'     - Build a custom agent
  'set up this project' - Initialize CAMI here

DISCOVERY
  'scout this project'  - Analyze and recommend agents
  'find my projects'    - Discover Claude Code projects

Say any command or describe what you need in your own words."
```

---

### Issue #30: Add progress indicators for multi-step operations

**State**: Open

#### Summary

Add progress communication patterns so users know operations are working during multi-step flows.

#### Examples

**Batch Deployment:**
```
CAMI: "Deploying 5 agents to my-app...
  Adding frontend-methodology... done
  Adding backend-methodology... done
  Adding testing-methodology... done
  Adding database-methodology... done
  Adding devops-methodology... done

All 5 deployed. Your roster is set."
```

**Source Update:**
```
CAMI: "Updating your sources...

Fetching fullstack-guild...
  3 new commits pulled
  +1 agent updated (frontend-methodology v1.3.0)

Fetching game-dev-guild...
  Already up to date

All sources updated."
```

#### When to Show Progress

| Operation | Progress? |
|-----------|-----------|
| Deploy 1 agent | No (too fast) |
| Deploy 2+ agents | Yes |
| Git pull 1 source | Brief |
| Git pull 2+ sources | Yes |
| Scan projects | Yes |

---

### Issue #31: Add post-operation undo guidance

**State**: Open

#### Summary

After batch operations, provide clear guidance on how to undo or modify what was just done.

#### Example

```
CAMI: "Deploying 5 agents to my-app...
  Adding frontend-methodology... done
  Adding backend-methodology... done
  Adding testing-methodology... done
  Adding database-methodology... done
  Adding devops-methodology... done

All 5 deployed. Your roster is set.

Changed your mind about any? Just say 'remove [agent-name]'."
```

---

### Issue #32: Expand error recovery patterns

**State**: Open

#### Summary

Ensure all error scenarios have clear recovery paths so users are never left stuck.

#### Error Pattern Structure

Every error should include:
1. **What happened** (clear, specific)
2. **Why** (if knowable)
3. **Recovery path** (what to do next)
4. **Alternative** (if recovery isn't possible)

#### Common Errors to Cover

**Workspace doesn't exist:**
```
CAMI: "I need your CAMI workspace to do that, but it doesn't exist yet.
Your workspace is where I track sources and deployments.
Want me to create it now? [y/n]"
```

**Source not found:**
```
CAMI: "I don't see a source called '[source-name]'.

Your configured sources:
  - fullstack (12 agents)
  - my-agents (3 agents)

Did you mean one of these? Or want to add a new source?"
```

**Agent not found:**
```
CAMI: "I couldn't find '[agent-name]' in your sources.

You can:
1. Create it - I'll help you design a custom agent
2. Search - Maybe it has a different name?
3. Add a source - It might be in a source you haven't added yet"
```

**Deployment conflict:**
```
CAMI: "[agent-name] already exists in this project with different content.

Deployed: v1.0.0 (modified 3 days ago)
Source: v1.2.0

Options:
1. Update - Replace with source version
2. Keep - Keep your version
3. Compare - Show me the differences"
```
