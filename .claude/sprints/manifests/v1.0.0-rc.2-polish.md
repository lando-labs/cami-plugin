### Issue #6: Create create-project skill

**Labels**: `skill`, `priority:medium`
**State**: Open

#### Description

Create the create-project skill for setting up new projects with recommended agent teams.

#### Skill Structure

```
skills/create-project/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    └── project-patterns.md
```

#### Workflow

1. **Gather Project Requirements** - name, location, type, tech stack, vision
2. **Recommend Agent Team** - based on project type
3. **Confirm Agent Selection** - allow adjustments
4. **Create Project Structure** - `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`
5. **Deploy Selected Capabilities** - copy from sources
6. **Create Initial Manifest** - `.claude/cami-manifest.yaml`
7. **Create Vision Document** - optional
8. **Update CLAUDE.md** - capability table
9. **Add to Tracked Locations** - optional

#### Location-Specific Behavior

| Location | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Workspace | Ask where to create |
| Project | "You're already in a project" |
| Initialization | Perfect! Initialize here |
| Navigation | Ask target directory |

#### Project Type → Agent Team Mappings

| Project Type | Recommended Agents |
|--------------|-------------------|
| E-commerce | architect, frontend, backend, database, payment, security, qa |
| SaaS | architect, frontend, backend, database, auth, qa |
| CLI Tool | specialist only (no architect) |
| Game (Phaser) | game-core, ui, audio, qa |
| Content Site | frontend, content, seo |

Continue? (y/n)
```

### Issue #20: Document full update workflow

**Labels**: `documentation`
**State**: Open

#### The Full Update Cycle

1. Update Sources (manage-sources)
2. Scan Deployed (manage-capabilities)
