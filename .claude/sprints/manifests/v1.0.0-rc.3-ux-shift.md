## Overview

- **Branch**: sprint/v1.0.0-rc.3-ux-shift
- **Target Version**: v1.0.0-rc.2 → v1.0.0-rc.3
- **Focus Area**: UX philosophy shift across all skills
- **Estimated Scope**: Large (comprehensive terminology + flow changes)

## Issues Addressed

### Must Complete
- [x] #25: UX: Shift from store-first to creation-first approach

## Philosophy Shift

### FROM (Store-First)
- "Here's our catalog of agents - which do you want?"
- Default action: Add a guild
- Official sources prominently featured
- Creation as secondary option

### TO (Creation-First)
- "What are you building? Let me help you create agents that fit."
- Default action: Understand user's needs, guide to creation
- Official sources as reference/inspiration only
- Pre-built agents as accelerator, not primary path

## Acceptance Criteria

### Terminology Changes
- [x] "guild" → "source" everywhere (except repo names)
- [x] File renamed: `official-guilds.md` → `reference/sources/official-registry.md`

### Flow Changes

## File Scope

### Files to Create
- `reference/sources/official-registry.md`

### Files to Modify
- `skills/cami/SKILL.md`
- `skills/manage-capabilities/SKILL.md`
- `skills/manage-sources/SKILL.md`
- `skills/create-project/SKILL.md`
- `skills/create-agent/SKILL.md`

## Parallel Agent Strategy

Launch agents in parallel by file/group:

| Agent | Files | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | `skills/cami/SKILL.md` | Entry skill UX flows |
| 2 | `skills/manage-capabilities/SKILL.md` | Capability discovery flows |
| 3 | `skills/manage-sources/SKILL.md` | Source terminology |
| 4 | `skills/create-project/SKILL.md` | Project init flows |
| 5 | `reference/sources/official-registry.md` (new) + delete old | Registry creation |
| 6 | `reference/voice/*` | Voice/terminology docs |
| 7 | `reference/ux/skill-architecture-spec.md` | UX spec patterns |
| 8 | `reference/config-schema.md` + `reference/patterns/error-recovery.md` | Reference docs |
| 9 | `README.md` | Public-facing docs |

## Key Replacement Patterns

### Terminology
| Current | Replacement |
|---------|-------------|
| "guild" (general) | "source" |
| "official guilds" | "official sources" |
| "add a guild" | "add a source" |
| "Guild Catalog" | "Source Registry" |

### Flow Messaging

**Zero-state:**
```
CURRENT: "Your sources are empty - no agents to show yet."
NEW: "No agents yet. Want to create one for your project, or browse pre-built sources?"
```

**Agent-not-found:**
```
CURRENT:
1. Add a guild that has it
2. Create a custom agent

NEW:
1. Create a custom agent (I'll help you build one)
2. Browse sources for pre-built options
```

**First-time:**
```
CURRENT: "Add the fullstack-guild to get started"
NEW: "What are you building? Let's create agents that fit your workflow."
```

## Dependencies

### Issue #25: UX: Shift from store-first to creation-first approach

**Labels**: (none)
**State**: Open

#### Summary

CAMI currently acts like a store promoting official guilds rather than a creation tool helping users build agents for their needs. This needs to change.

#### Analysis Findings

**Current Bias (6:1 toward consumption)**

| Skill | Guild/Official Mentions | Agent Creation Mentions | Ratio |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| cami | 14 | 4 | 3.5:1 |
| manage-capabilities | 11 | 3 | 3.7:1 |
| manage-sources | 34 | 3 | 11:1 |
| **Total** | **~59** | **~10** | **6:1** |

#### Problem Areas

1. Zero-state flow pushes guild selection, not creation
2. First-time user gets "Want me to add fullstack-guild?"
3. Agent not found suggests "Add a source that has it" before "Create it"
4. Project init assumes agents exist, offers "deploy" or "browse"
5. Guild tables hardcoded in skill files (will go stale)

#### Acceptance Criteria (from issue)

- [ ] `reference/sources/official-registry.md` created
- [ ] Guild tables removed from all skill files
- [ ] "guild" terminology replaced with "source"
- [ ] Zero-state flows lead with creation, not browsing
- [ ] Agent-not-found defaults to creation offer
- [ ] First-time setup asks about project, not guild selection
- [ ] Official sources framed as reference/templates

#### Metrics for Success

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Guild mentions in skills | ~59 | <10 |
| Creation mentions in skills | ~10 | Primary throughout |
| Zero-state default | "Pick a guild" | "What are you building?" |
| Agent-not-found default | "Add a source" | "Let me help create it" |
