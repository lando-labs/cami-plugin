## File Scope

### Files to Create

- `skills/create-agent/references/agent-vs-skill.md` - Decision guide
- `agents/agent-architect.md` - v5.0.0 architect

### Files to Verify/Update
- `agents/skill-architect.md` - Verify ready for plugin

## Dependencies

- Sprint 2 complete ✓ (manage-capabilities for deployment)
- Voice references exist ✓ (`reference/voice/`)
- Tech detection exists ✓ (`reference/tech-detection.md`)

## Parallel Work Considerations

### Sprint Scope (Implementation Works Here)
- `skills/create-agent/`
- `agents/`

### Protected Areas
- `skills/cami/` - Entry skill (complete)
- `skills/manage-capabilities/` - (complete)
- `skills/manage-sources/` - (complete)
- `reference/` - Voice and config docs (complete)

## Git Workflow

- **Branch from**: main
- **Branch name**: sprint/v1.0.0-rc.1-agent-creation
- **Commit prefix**: [agents]
- **PR template**: Standard with sprint checklist

### Commit Strategy
```
[agents] feat: create create-agent skill (Refs: #5)
[agents] feat: update agent-architect to v5.0.0 (Refs: #21)
[agents] docs: verify skill-architect readiness (Refs: #22)
```

## Rollback Plan

- Each component is independent
- Can revert individual commits without affecting core skills
- Architects can be reverted without breaking create-agent skill

### Issue #5: Create create-agent skill

**Labels**: `skill`, `priority:high`
**State**: Open

#### Description

Create the create-agent skill that guides users through agent creation and invokes agent-architect.

**Critical**: This skill must understand:
1. The difference between agents and skills (guide to right choice)
2. The user's location (workspace vs project affects where to save)

#### Skill Structure

```
skills/create-agent/
├── SKILL.md
└── references/
    ├── agent-classes.md
    ├── agent-vs-skill.md
    └── save-locations.md
```

#### Step 0: Detect Agent vs Skill Need

Before creating an agent, determine if user actually needs a skill:

**Workflow/Checklist signals → Recommend SKILL**
- "checklist", "procedure", "steps", "workflow"
- "every time I deploy", "whenever I commit"
- Repeatable, procedural tasks

**Methodology/Judgment signals → Create AGENT**
- "expert", "specialist", "architect"
- "decisions about", "when to", "best practices"
- Requires judgment, trade-offs, domain expertise

#### Two-Class System

| Signal | Class | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| "build", "implement", "feature", "frontend", "backend" | methodology-specialist | Domain expertise + skill pairing |
| "architect", "research", "plan", "optimize", "security" | strategic-planner | Architecture, research, decisions |

**Note**: workflow-specialist is retired. Use SKILLS for repeatable procedures.

#### Location-Specific Save Behavior

| Location | Default Save | Options |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `~/cami-workspace/` | `sources/my-agents/` | Choose source |
| Project with `.claude/` | **Ask user** | Source or project-local |
| Project without `.claude/` | **Ask user** | Source or initialize project |
| Other | `sources/my-agents/` | Guide to workspace |

#### Roster-Building Workflow

Triggers: "help me build my agent roster", "what agents do I need for [project]"

1. Detect location and target project
2. Analyze project (auto-detect tech stack)
3. Recommend methodology agents for each domain
4. Recommend implementation skills for tech stack
5. Ask: save to sources or project-local?
6. Create missing agents via agent-architect
7. Deploy all via manage-capabilities

### Issue #21: Update agent-architect to v5.0.0

**Labels**: `priority:high`
**State**: Open

#### Description

Major update to agent-architect incorporating the best of `skilled-agent-architect` and adapting for the skills-only plugin architecture.

This is a **breaking change** (v4.0.0 → v5.0.0).

#### Core Changes

**1. Two-Class System (Remove workflow-specialist)**

| Class | Name | Purpose | Model |
|-------|------|---------|-------|
| methodology-specialist | Feature Builder | Domain expertise + skill pairing | sonnet |
| strategic-planner | System Architect | Architecture, research, decisions | opus |

**Why**: Workflow-specialist describes exactly what **skills** are for.

**2. Skill-Awareness**

```markdown
## Working with Skills

This agent is designed to work with implementation skills.

### Discovering Skills
At the start of any task:
1. Check for `.claude/skills/` directory
2. Read available SKILL.md files
3. Identify complementary skills

### Skill Boundaries
Skills provide: Code syntax, framework patterns, file structures
You provide: When to use, quality judgment, decision-making
```

**3. Methodology Over Implementation**

| Aspect | Agent (Methodology) | Skill (Implementation) |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Provides | Judgment, decisions | Patterns, syntax |
| Answers | WHEN and WHY | HOW and WHAT |
| Tech-specific? | No (agnostic) | Yes (framework-specific) |

**4. Workflow → Skill Redirect**

When users ask for workflow/checklist agents, redirect to skill creation.

**5. Replace STRATEGIES.yaml References**

Use auto-detection from project files (per #14).

**6. Retire skilled-agent-architect**

- `agent-architect` becomes the single agent for creating agents
- `skilled-agent-architect` is retired (functionality merged)

#### New Agent Structure

```markdown
---
name: domain-methodology
version: "1.0.0"
description: Use this agent PROACTIVELY when [methodology scenarios]
class: methodology-specialist
specialty: domain-methodology
model: sonnet
skill_aware: true
---

You are the [Domain] Methodology Expert...

## Core Philosophy
[Universal principle that transcends technology]

## Working with Skills
[Standard skill integration section]

## Boundaries
**You OWN**: Methodology, judgment, quality standards
**You DELEGATE**: Code syntax, patterns (to skills)
**You ESCALATE**: Out-of-scope (to other agents)
```

---

### Issue #22: Verify skill-architect readiness for plugin

**Labels**: `documentation`
**State**: Open

#### Description

Verify that `skill-architect` (v2.0.0) is ready to ship with the cami-plugin.

The plugin will ship two architects:
- `agent-architect` - Creates methodology-focused agents (v5.0.0)
- `skill-architect` - Creates implementation skills

#### Verification Checklist

1. **Current State Review**
   - Read current skill-architect
   - Verify v2.0.0 is production-ready
   - Check for any STRATEGIES.yaml references (should be removed)

2. **Plugin Integration**
   - Works standalone (no MCP dependencies)?
   - All referenced tools available in plugin context?
   - Plugin-specific adjustments needed?

3. **Alignment with Agent-Architect v5.0.0**
   - Consistent terminology (methodology vs implementation)
   - Clear handoff points
   - Complementary scope (no overlap, no gaps)

#### Potential Updates Needed

1. Remove any STRATEGIES.yaml references
2. Add agent-pairing guidance
3. Update trigger detection
4. Skill recommendations at end of creation
