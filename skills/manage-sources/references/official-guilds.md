## Adding New Official Guilds

When Lando Labs publishes new guilds, update this reference file:

1. Add guild entry with URL, focus, contents estimate
2. Describe specialties and when to use
3. Keep consistent format with existing entries

## Guild Naming Conventions

Official guilds follow the pattern: `[domain]-guild`

Examples:
- `fullstack-guild` (web development)
- `content-guild` (writing/marketing)
- `game-dev-guild` (game development)

Future potential guilds:
- `mobile-guild` (iOS/Android development)
- `data-guild` (data engineering and ML)
- `devops-guild` (infrastructure and deployment)
- `design-guild` (UI/UX design)

## Guild vs Source

**Guild**: Official collection maintained by Lando Labs
- Curated agents and skills
- Regularly updated
- Quality guaranteed
- Focus on common domains

**Source**: Any git repository with CAMI-compatible agents/skills
- Can be official guilds
- Can be community repos
- Can be user's personal collection
- Can be private/custom repos

When helping users, use "guild" for official collections and "source" for the broader category.
